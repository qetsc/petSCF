PSCF is developed to perform parameterized self-consistend-field calculations such as semi-empirical molecular orbital
methods (MNDO,PM3, etc) and density-functional based tight binding (DFTB).

Currently only MINDO/3 method is implemented.

PSCF makes use of PyQuante (http://pyquante.sourceforge.net/) molecule class.
All matrix operations are based on petsc4py (https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc4py/) and slepc4py (https://bitbucket.org/slepc/slepc4py/).
SIPs code is written by Hong Zhang. 

If you have these packages installed, you don't need any additional installations. 
PSCF is basically a python code build on top of these packages.

PyQuante installation:
Simply download the tarball from http://pyquante.sourceforge.net/ and run `python setup.py install`.

slepc4py installation:
Requires, slepc, petsc4py, petsc...
