PSCF is developed to perform paraemeterized self-consistend-field calculations such as semi-empirical molecular orbital
methods (MNDO,PM3, etc) and density-functional based tight binding (DFTB)

Currently only MINDO/3 method is implemented.

PSCF is based on PyQuante (http://pyquante.sourceforge.net/) and slepc4py (https://bitbucket.org/slepc/slepc4py/).

If you have these packages installed, you don't need any additional installations. PSCF is basically a python script
build on top of these packages.

PyQuante installation:
Simply download the tarball from the sourceforge and run `python setup.py install`.

slepc4py installation:
Requires, slepc, petsc4py, petsc...
