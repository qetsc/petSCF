# PSCF
PSCF is developed to perform Parameterized Self-Consistend-Field calculations such as semi-empirical molecular orbital
(MNDO,PM3, etc) or density-functional based tight binding (DFTB) methods for large systems, where all the relevant matrices are sparse.

* Currently only MINDO/3 method is implemented.
* PSCF is based on PyQuante (http://pyquante.sourceforge.net/).
* All matrix operations are based on petsc4py (https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc4py/) and slepc4py (https://bitbucket.org/slepc/slepc4py/).
* Not useful for anything right now, stay tuned...
* For more info contact Murat Keceli: keceli at gmail
* Computationally intensive parts are written in C by Hong Zhang and will be contained in SIPs module.

## Installation
* PSCF is basically a python code build on top of PyQuante, petsc4py and slepc4py.
* If you have these packages installed, you don't need any additional installations.

### PyQuante installation:
* Download the tarball from http://pyquante.sourceforge.net/
* run `python setup.py install`.

### slepc4py installation:
* Requires, petsc, slepc, petsc4py, mpi4py...
* Start from http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/
* Required packages with petsc installation:
  * MUMPS
  * PT-SCOTCH
  * SCALAPACK
